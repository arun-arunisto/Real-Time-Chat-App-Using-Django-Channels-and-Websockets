### Django Channels
Django Channels is an extension to the Django framework that enables asynchronous and real-time capabilities. While traditional Django applications rely on a synchronous request-response model, Django Channels allows you to handle asynchronous tasks and implement real-time features such as chat applications, notifications, and live updates.
### Websockets
WebSockets are a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Unlike the traditional HTTP request-response cycle, WebSockets allow for bi-directional communication, making them ideal for real-time applications. Django Channels leverages WebSockets to enable real-time functionality within Django.
